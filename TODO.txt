say: we quantify bounds of good performance

Crucially, we are able to quantify the bounds of regions of good performance for each setup -- results which should be useful to anyone implementing streaming applications in novel contexts, especially those outside typical enterprise use-cases.


caveat - config spark to do anything, opt config options, use different integrations
-- this is more out of box compare
-- +ve of HIO



- ref fig 2 in experimental setup

- refer back to fig 6 in concs

- edit conc section. - flabby

equations to explain theo bounds?

figure vs Figure ?


plots -- legend labs?
- different x's for gryscle

- add lines to prediction plot?

- add additional prediction for performance profile?

DPI for normed - fig 6.


- page count?
- submission target?
- upload arXiv ?


---DONE---

- A B C for figure 

fig 6 -- show as fraction of max? --- No

- rescue 'lesrning cuve/soft' para from previous version - DONE?
